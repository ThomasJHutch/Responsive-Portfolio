        Hello, my name is Tom and I will be 25 on November 15, 2019. It's an
        important life changing milestone at 1/4 a century old and the beginning
        of a new decade in 2020.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a Texas A&M graduate with a B.S. in Business management and minors
        in economics and communications.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been in search of a brighter and more exciting career path for
        about a year now. I Have just started a fantastic job as the SEO and Web
        Content specialist for a major eComerce company while taking this
        program and can't wait to get started.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have had an interest in computers and engineering my whole life and
        have been building them for over 10 years now; it's high time I learned
        to code too. I learned HTML in highschool along with Photoshop, after
        effects, premier pro and cinematography, hopefully that experience helps
        with the Bootcamp.
      </p>

      <p>
        My hobbies include Nerdy movies, Space exploration, computer building,
        Video Games, playing guitar, tinkering with my Audi S3 and my dog Glide.
        So lets talk about Star wars, SpaceX, Linus Tech Tips, CoD, Les Paul's,
        Audi's and dogs! :)
